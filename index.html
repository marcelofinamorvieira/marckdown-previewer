  # GitHub markdown previewer
  ## In this editor you can preview text trough the GitHub markdowns
  #### Don't know how Markdown works? Here is the [Documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  Markdown is a powerful and practical way to style text on the web and with it you can do several things, like:
  
  You can do `Inline codes` using backticks, or even
  
  ```
  //Multiline code with triple backticks
  console.log("Amazing!");
  console.log("Isn't it?");
  ```
  
  You can make lists like:
  
  * Unordered lists
  1. Or even ordered lists
  
And even blockquotes to expose your genius moments:
  
  > I never apologize, i'm sorry but that's just the way i am.
  
  > -Unknown
  
You can include some images as well:

And of corse, make your text **bold** and *italic*.
